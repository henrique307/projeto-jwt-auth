# projeto-jwt-auth
authentication system that i build based on a youtube video for studying purposes, i might make some changes and tests.

## How to use

1. Clone repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start`to start the server.
4. Go to your browser and type `localhost:3000`, that will redirect you to the login page

## About the project

as there is no database, every change u make will restart the server, erasing all the accounts, but it should be good for a general ideia of how it works ;)
